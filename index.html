    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the fixed charge coverage ratio<br> 
    What is the fixed charge coverage ratio?<br>
    the fixed charge coverage ratio (FCCR) is a measurement of a firm's capacity to meet fixed charge obligations such as lease expenses and interest expenses. Higher fixed charge coverage ratio indicates a financially healthy and less risky company. Lower fixed charge coverage ratio indicates a company that is struggling to meet it's payments.<br>
    How to calculate fixed charge coverage ratio?<br>
    To calculate fixed charge coverage ratio you should use the following formula:<br>
    fixed charge coverage ratio = (EBITDA - capex - cash taxes) / (interest + principal + capital lease payments)<br>
    example: company x has a monthly expenses include lease payments of $7,000. The company generated EBITDA of $680,000 and $43,000 of annual principal repayments. Annually it spends $3,000 to replace some equipments in the current year the company paid $52,000 in taxes, calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio of the company?<br>
    First we should convert monthly fixed charges to annual amounts:<br>
    lease payments = $7,000 * 12<br>
    lease payments = $84,000<br>
    Now let's calculate the fixed charge coverage ratio:<br>
    using the fixed charge coverage ratio the answer will be:<br>
    fixed charge coverage ratio = (EBITDA - capex - cash taxes) / (interest + principal + capital lease payments)<br>
    fixed charge coverage ratio = ($680,000 - $3,000 - $52,000) / ($43,000 + $29,000 + $84,000)<br>
    fixed charge coverage ratio = 4<br>
    Why use fixed charge coverage ratio?<br>
    The fixed charge coverage ratio is usually used by lenders analyzing the amount of cash flow a firm has available for debt repayment. A low ratio indicates a lack of ability to make payments on fixed charges.<br>
